## Run the middleware Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Maanaesh/FreshService-Middleware.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd FreshService-Middleware
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

server should return something like this 
```bash
MySQL pool created
Database connected successfully
Middleware listening on port 5001
```

## Events
#### `onAppInstall` Event

When the onAppInstall event is triggered, the middleware performs the following actions:

- #### Field Mapping: 
    
    - Passes the maps of Freshservice and Freshdesk fields to the Node.js server.

- #### Database Operations:
    - Based on the provided field map, it creates a MySQL table called Tickets. If the table already exists, the middleware creates a backup of the existing table before dropping and recreating the new table with updated fields.

- ## How It Works:
-   #### Event Trigger:

    - The event is triggered when the app is installed in Freshservice

    - Field Mapping:

        - A map of Freshservice fields and Freshdesk fields is passed to the Node.js server.

        - These field maps are used to define the columns in the Tickets table.

- #### MySQL Table Creation:

    - The app connects to the MySQL server and checks if the Tickets table exists.

    -   #### If the table exists:

        - It creates a backup of the existing table (renaming the table to Tickets_backup_<timestamp>).

        - Drops the old Tickets table.

    - A new Tickets table is created based on the provided field mappings.


#### `onTicketCreate` Event
When the `onTicketCreate` event is triggered in the serverless Freshservice application, the middleware performs the 
following actions:

- Field Filtering

    - Filters out fields based on the map of Freshdesk and   Freshservice fields stored in the `iparams`.
    
    -   The serverless app appends the email id field to the ticket, where the value is the requester‚Äôs email id.

- Ticket Forwarding

    - The filtered ticket, containing only the selected fields, is sent to the Node.js server.
- ## How It Works

-   #### Field Filtering and Email Append
    - The serverless application filters the ticket fields according to the field mappings stored in iparams for Freshservice and Freshdesk.
    - The email id field is added to the ticket, with the value set to the requester's email address.
- #### Sending to Node.js Server
    - The filtered ticket, now with the necessary fields, is sent to the Node.js server for further processing.
- #### MySQL Table Check and Alteration
    - The Node.js server checks the Tickets table for the columns `email` and `pushed_to_freshdesk`.
    - If these columns do not exist:
        - The Tickets table is altered to include the `email` and `pushed_to_freshdesk` columns.
    - The ticket is then stored in the `Tickets` table.

## Scope of Improvements

1. **Ticket Email ID Usage for Updates**:
   - Currently, the email ID associated with the ticket is used to update tickets. This could cause potential issues, especially if multiple tickets share the same email ID or if tickets need to be differentiated by other fields. It's important to explore alternative, more reliable methods of identifying and updating tickets, such as using unique ticket IDs instead of email addresses.

2. **Bulk Upload of Tickets**:
   - The current implementation uploads tickets to Freshdesk one at a time via individual API calls. This approach can be inefficient for a large volume of tickets. There is a need to implement a bulk upload mechanism that uploads multiple tickets to Freshdesk in a single API call. This can significantly reduce API request overhead and improve performance, especially when importing tickets from an SQL server.

3. **Handling SQL Data Types**:
   - SQL server currently assumes all ticket fields as strings, except for the `status` and `priority` fields. However, Freshdesk ticket fields might have different data types (e.g., dates, numbers, booleans). The implementation should be improved by fetching and dynamically applying the correct field types when processing ticket data from SQL to ensure consistency with Freshdesk‚Äôs ticket schema.
